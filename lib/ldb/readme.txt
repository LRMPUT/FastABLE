    Runing the Unit Tests
    
    This project has been tested with GCC 4.7.1, and OpenCV is also 
	required to build the binary. Make sure that the version of 
	OpenCV is 2.4.0 or above.

    ldb image1 image2 flag
	
    where flag determine whether to rotate the image window as follows:
	0  donâ€™t rotate image window
    1  rotate image window.
